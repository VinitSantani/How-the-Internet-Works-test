          <p>I, Vinit Santani, am a first semester full time graduate student for Business and Information Systems. I have completed my undergraduate degree from Mumbai, India.</p>
          <p>The purpose of this assignment is to teach us how to create and develop a fully functioning website.</p>
<p>I did not have any previous coding experience until last time so naturally web development with html and bootstrap was a scary task for the first time, but after watching Professor Williams's demo videos and doing some additional research I was able to successfully complete the task at hand!</p>
<p>I got a chance to solidify the git collaboration skills from the previous project and am now more comfortable using PyCharm and utilizing some of is unique features for web development. Taking the time to learn about html and bootstrapping will pay dividends in the future as the internet becomes more and more prevalent. It is impossible to escape using such a core language as html and bootstrapping enhances the webpages that we develop.</p>
<p>In addition to learning how to use these languages, I also learned about the how the internet works. This gave a crucial background that helped put into context how we got to where we are today. I also learned how different transmission media is used for global communication like wires, cables and Wi-Fi, computers connecting via IP addresses, requesting web pages via DNS, how does routing packets helps in reliability, about HTTP and HTML and various encryption systems to keep us safe.</p>
<p>In all, this project was a great opportunity to get hands on experience with web development. It has taught us lessons about how we can build webpages easily. Previously, we had this stigma around coding in html, but once we realized that there are templates that we can utilize for everything and that we donâ€™t need to memorize every bit of code, we were able to move much quicker by picking and choosing specific parts of a webpage that we like and incorporating that into our own.</p>
